 This is a demo page to show how to use Simple CSS and JavaScript trick to integrate Dark-Mode on your page using filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg); to invert the colors and using JS to control the rest of elements and events.

This is kind of a shortcut for toggling Dark-Mode and not suiatble for Complex UI Designs as the property inverts everything and if you have a complex color scheme going on, this is not ideal. 

This demo is inspired by this video - https://youtu.be/qimopjP6YoM and This Article - https://dev.to/ekaterina_vu/dark-mode-with-one-line-of-code-4lkm and the Iconic Star Wars Universe.
